# Learning Go

Starting date with Go: May 15, 2020

I probably started earlier with Go, but it was on that date that I built something professional with Go.

| **7. Microservices Architecture (Go)**  | 3 months | Split the monolith into microservices communicating via gRPC.                                      | Distributed design, observability, Docker/Kubernetes deployment.                   |
| **8. Zero to Production in Rust**       | 2 months | Work through *Zero to Production in Rust* from start to finish.                                    | Master **Axum**, SQLx, async Rust, error handling, and structured logging.         |
| **9. Axum Rewrite of Let‚Äôs Go Further** | 3 months | Re-implement the *Let‚Äôs Go Further* backend using **Axum** and PostgreSQL.                         | Translate Go patterns into idiomatic Axum-based Rust; strong typing and ownership. |
| **10. Axum + gRPC Integration**         | 3 months | Expose gRPC endpoints using **Tonic** alongside Axum HTTP routes.                                  | Hybrid Axum + Tonic stack, shared protobuf types, secure interceptors.             |

## How to work with custom packages

- Create a project and store it in GitHub (https://github.com/thegodeveloper/logging)
- Execute `go get github.com/thegodeveloper/logging`
- Call it from `main.go`

## Install goimports

Enhanced version of `go fmt` called `goimports`.

```shell
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
```

To run it across a project:

```shell
goimports -l -w .
```

- The `-l` flat tells `goimports` to print the files with incorrect formatting to the console.
- The `-w` flag tells `goimports` to modify the files in-place.
- The `.` specifies the files to be scanned: everything in the current directory and all of its subdirectories.

## go vet

There is another class of errors that developers run into. The code is syntactically valid, but there are mistakes that are not what you meant to do.
This includes things like passing the wrong number of parameters to formatting methods or assigning values to variables that are never used.

Run `go vet` on your project with the command:

```shell
go vet ./...

# github.com/thegodeveloper/learning-go/wTime
wTime/master.go:13:25: 2006-02-01 should be 2006-01-02
```

## ToDo

- Refactor the w-directories
